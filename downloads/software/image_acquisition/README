The current openSIM software is implemented for the two camera models Andor Zyla and Andor iXon 
by using the Andor software development kid (SDK3) for LabVIEW. In case you want to use openSIM 
with one of this Andor cameras and the Andor SDK3, we can provide the respective version on request. 

To make the project more open we are also sharing the complete LabVIEW project of the openSIM 
interface without the camera specific subVIs. In this way everybody can adapt the software to 
their own needs such as the integration of a different camera model or the implementation of 
additional system requirements. 
--> openSIM_labview_withoutSpecVIcamera_V2.0

We also provide an executable version of the openSIM software. 
This version cannot be used for actual image acquisition. 
The purpose of this executable version is to visualize the structure of the 
interface without the need of having LabVIEW.
