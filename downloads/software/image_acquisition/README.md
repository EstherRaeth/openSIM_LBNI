We currently offer three software versions to cater to various user requirements (see openSIM website section 'Additional information'-'openSIM software' for more information): 

**Full openSIM LabView Project Versions:** For users seeking to modify or customize the software, we provide two full LabView projects. The first version, "openSIM_software_withCameraControl," integrates complete camera control, including image acquisition and data handling, specifically designed for Andor Zyla and Andor iXon camera models. The second version maintains the same structure but omits camera-model-specific components, making it modular and adaptable for other camera models. 
To address the reviewerâ€™s comment, we developed an additional software version based on which we built an application that we now provide on the openSIM repository. 


**openSIM Application (exe):** To overcome the need for any chargeable licenses and to offer a more open-source software option, we created an openSIM software version which allowed us to build an application from it. This software version is designed for user who primarily want to use the software without any need for modification. Running the software version doesn't require any paid software licenses and is not tied to a specific camera model.
