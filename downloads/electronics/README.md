The files in the folder 'CAMOutputs' are required when ordering the PCB. (GerberFiles: Gerber files are a standard file format used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCBs). These files contain the information necessary to guide the PCB fabrication process and ensure that the PCB is manufactured to the design specifications. Gerber files typically include data on the various layers of the PCB, such as the copper traces, solder mask, silkscreen, drill holes, and other relevant features. PCB design software generates these files, and they are then provided to a PCB manufacturer for the production of the actual circuit board.)

In the folder 'additional information' information on the PCB population can be found. The folder contains also a subfolder 'EAGLE_files' containing the PCB design files (.brd, .sch) in case a user seeks more information or wants to modify the board. These files have to be opened with the Eagle (electronic design software). A free version of Eagle can be downloaded here: http://eagle.autodesk.com/eagle/software-versions/7
