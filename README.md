## an open-source structured illumination add-on for fluorescence microscopes

The resolution of conventional optical microscopes is limited by light diffraction to about 200nm. Several superresolution techniques have been recently developed to overcome this limit such as PALM, STORM, STED, SIM. Among them, **SIM (structured illumination microscopy)** is one of the most suited for biological imaging.

The **open source hardware project openSIM** is an **add-on** designed at the *Laboratory for Bio- and Nano- Instrumentation (LBNI, EPFL)* (https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lbni/) to **upgrade conventional fluorescence microscopes for superresolution imaging**. The openSIM has been designed specifically so that it can be 3D printed and built easily by other researchers using a set of instructions. Our goal is to reach labs worldwide and build a vibrant **open-hardware community**.



A detailed documentation with all the information to build and use the openSIM is provided on our openSIM webpage.
